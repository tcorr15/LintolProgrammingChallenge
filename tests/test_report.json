There is flexibility in light of the pandemic, which is welcome, but politics is not just about what happens in the Building; it is about what happens in communities. It does not affect me as a Belfast MLA, but, quite often, MLAs have to travel when that may not be conducive to their or their constituents time. We need to look at and address proxy voting in the long term. Currently, proxy voting may not suit everybody. I am a single MLA, and there are other single MLAs and parties, and others who are independents, such as [GDPRREDACT] and [GDPRREDACT]. They have said that they may not want to lend their vote, so to speak, to other parties because they want to be independent or separate. That needs to be looked at in the long term.",

The current Peace programme is continuing to roll out until the end of this year, and the new funding will come in then from the next financial year and beyond. It is a substantial amount of money over six or seven years. There will undoubtedly be, as there always is with Peace funding, huge demand on the ground. As you will know, PEACE PLUS is taking in the INTERREG proportion of that, as well as the Peace programme. Nonetheless, I am very pleased that we have managed to bring it up from what was originally sitting at about EUR650 million to EUR1 billion.

That brings the total amount of funding up to about EUR1 billion, and that will be over six or seven years for the roll-out. The current Peace programme is continuing to roll out until the end of this year, and the new funding will come in then from the next financial year and beyond. It is a substantial amount of money over six or seven years. There will undoubtedly be, as there always is with Peace funding, huge demand on the ground. As you will know, PEACE PLUS is taking in the INTERREG proportion of that, as well as the Peace programme. Nonetheless, I am very pleased that we have managed to bring it up from what was originally sitting at about EUR650 million to EUR1 billion. I have no doubt that, if we can get the programme designed correctly and if people engage with this consultation as it comes out this month, then we can get the best possible usage of that on the ground where it is needed.",

There will be a quad meeting this afternoon between us, the Secretary of State and Ministers from the Republic of Ireland, at which, I am sure, that issue will be raised. The Member will be aware that there were concerns about the sharing of data and information on passenger locator forms. That work is still ongoing. We hope that there will be a resolution as to how that data can be shared. The Member knows that, if we do not get that information from people landing at Dublin Airport, there is a weakness in the steps that we take in Northern Ireland, so we need a two-island approach, as he rightly acknowledged in his question.",
