            Nevertheless, the changes are welcome now, but there is something else -- I and others have raised it in Committee -- that needs to be teased out: the proxy voting system is too rigid. There is flexibility in light of the pandemic, which is welcome, but politics is not just about what happens in the Building; it is about what happens in communities. It does not affect me as a Belfast MLA, but, quite often, MLAs have to travel when that may not be conducive to their or their constituents time. We need to look at and address proxy voting in the long term. Currently, proxy voting may not suit everybody. I am a single MLA, and there are other single MLAs and parties, and others who are independents, such as [GDPRREDACT] and [GDPRREDACT]. They have said that they may not want to lend their vote, so to speak, to other parties because they want to be independent or separate. That needs to be looked at in the long term.

            Some of the language and rhetoric used about the protocol is not just irresponsible; it is inaccurate . One of the big areas of disruption for east-west trade has been on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules, the movement of plant and animal products across the Irish Sea. No one anywhere has plausibly suggested that there could be a border in plant and animal health rules on the island of Ireland. There are farms that straddle both jurisdictions on the island. It is implausible. We need to be honest with one another and the people whom we represent. I see the Member for North Antrim smiling at that, but we all have a responsibility.

            I commend the Member for North Antrim for bringing this Matter of the Day to the Floor. I will use calm and particularly moderate language. Bear in mind the number of times that I have raised, in the Assembly, the issue of us all working together to make sure that there are appropriate derogations. I have said that the protocol, if it ever came into position, should not be designed to damage the Northern Ireland economy, which, quite frankly, it is.

            A wide range of issues need to be resolved. My party is working on those. I challenge others around the Chamber today to say what work they have been doing to resolve the issues. That is what we are about. Bespoke solutions are needed to issues such as SPS checks, parcels, pet passports, mutual recognition of qualifications, trade into and out of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, groupage, qualifying goods, frontier workers, the shared prosperity fund, environmental issues and employment law issues. A long list of issues need to be resolved between the United Kingdom and the EU, to the benefit of Northern Ireland. We need to work on those issues, not shout and scream at each other across the Chamber. I have to say to [GDPRREDACT] that I am not aware of anyone in Northern Ireland who has been starved as a result of [GDPRREDACT]. I am aware, however, of those who struggle to put food on the table -- shame on the House and the parties in the Chamber that have contributed to that.

            Scotland might have been consulting early, but they did not know the amount of funding that they would have, and neither did Wales. I had a conversation with both Finance Ministers last week, and Scotland only launched its Budget last Thursday, I think. The Administration may have been having a broad consultation on what priorities people would like to see. Of course, there are about PS1*7 billion of pressures that our Departments would have liked to spend money on but cannot now meet. It is a question of judgement. People can go out and consult if they wish, but, if they do not know the funding envelope that they are operating from, arguably the consultation is rendered null and void. Certainly in relation to the last question, a Department, with all good intent, wanted to do a scheme and then found out very abruptly at the end of November/start of December that the funding was not available for that unless it reprioritised within the Department and decided to take funding from somewhere else.

            Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to this Matter of the Day. It is a very important matter, of course. The actions of the European Union on Friday last have caused significant dismay and distress, as the Member who secured the Matter of the Day said. It was wrong and unnecessary, and I think that we all know that that was the case. The first strike by the European Union of triggering article 16 at the very first opportunity and without consultation -- without, it appears, thought for or consideration of the welfare of the people of Northern Ireland -- has rightly been condemned by all.

            First, it is important to be clear about what the European Union did. The export controls extended only to Great Britain due to the existence of the protocol, and, therefore, the EU had to take deliberate and particular action to trigger article 16 in order to ensure that we, the people of Northern Ireland, would not be able to obtain any vaccines through that route. I think that that is very striking and very horrific in equal measure. It is also important to highlight the nature of the action of the European Union. This was no accident or some inadvertent mistake, as some have tried to allege. The EU had been working on this all last week. It was done with purpose, and it was done with intention. It was only due to the public furore that it changed its mind. However, I think that Members need to realise that even that U-turn comes with heavy caveats. The statement from the European Union makes clear that it holds in reserve invoking article 16 and that it intends to do that if it feels that it needs to. That does not give any assurance or guarantee, and that is completely unacceptable.

The EU triggered article 16, before it rightfully backtracked under significant pressure, in order to protect an anticipated problem with its supply lines. Article 16 allows unilateral action by any party to the protocol in order to protect against serious harm caused by the provisions, which means that the United Kingdom can take action, without agreement, to protect disruption on our supply lines and to protect the people of Northern Ireland.

If we call article 16, as I hope the Prime Minister does, we have an opportunity for reflection and discussion.

            Here is the significant issue: there is no Northern Ireland voice at the table. We can attend and sit as observers, but we are not treated as equals with the British Government or the Europeans. That has to change. Indeed, when the vice president of the European Commission says that we need to have a "reset", we should do that; we should call article 16 and take a considerable time in reflection to sort this out. However, the Assembly and the parties of the Northern Ireland Executive should have a seat at that table to be able to make those decisions. We cannot do that at the moment because, quite frankly, the EU has shown that the best interests of Northern Ireland are not at its heart, and I am not overly sure that [GDPRREDACT] has the best interests of Northern Ireland at his heart either.

            It is important that we all calmly address the issues that are in front of us today. The article 16 debacle that took place over the weekend actually has an upside: it has opened a door for further and genuine discussion between the EU and GB. I have to say respectfully that the GB Government addressed the issue well over the weekend. It has also clearly achieved an opportunity for all the parties in the Chamber to get together to address the issues. I call on the First Minister --

            Sadly, some of the contributions today have been entirely predictable, but let me be clear: the European Commissions decision to invoke article 16 on Friday was wrong. Those who invoked it would do well to learn a lot more about Northern Ireland, to ensure that lessons are genuinely learnt and perhaps to take this week to read the Good Friday Agreement, plus the background to the establishment of the European Union. Vaccine nationalism certainly was not part of the vision set out by the founders of the European Union. To those in the House who now call for retaliatory action, simply put: two wrongs do not make a right, and nor do ongoing inflammatory language and tactics help to resolve problems. All that those tactics do is a disservice to consumers and businesses.

            In recent days, there has been a lot of talk about a reset of the UK-EU relationship. Of course, the protocol needs to be dealt with once and for all. We warned about the way in which the EU was using Northern Ireland over the past four years to punish the wider United Kingdom. Once again, that was proven right on Friday evening. [GDPRREDACT] told us all to be calm, and the SDLP told us all to watch our tone. My goodness. This is from the parties that, along with Alliance, have spent the past four years hyping up the border and hyping up the threat of IRA violence. It was to the detriment of the people whom we all represent and to the United Kingdom to which we belong. "Rigorously implement the protocol" was the cry from the three parties opposite. Will they now change their minds? Will they now accept that the protocol to which they clung to, and to which they continue to cling, is causing serious harm to our country? The European Unions mask has slipped. It has said, however, once again, that it is prepared to take action if it suits its agenda. The United Kingdom Government need to step up. They need to listen to all views in Northern Ireland and to what is being said on the ground in our communities. On the radio this morning, the SDLP leader said that this was a mistake and that the decision to invoke article 16 came from somebody who did not understand the protocol. That is a disgraceful excuse. I urge the parties in the Chamber today to stand up and be counted for the people whom we represent, to listen to all communities and to not ride roughshod over the unionist community.

The threat of school closure has hung over the rural community of [GDPRREDACT] for a number of years. As is often the case for many small rural schools, instead of the school being allowed to grow to meet enrolment targets, bureaucratic decisions were made on the basis of funding, transport and nursery provision that sometimes serve only to stifle growth and allow the closure debate to grow legs. The Department of Educations decision in November 2019 to close the school in August 2020 was met with a vociferous local campaign to keep it open. It should also be said that the campaign has the support of all political parties locally.

            I came to the Committee late in the process, when evidence had already been taken. It was of value for the Committee to look into this and to see ways in which we could reflect, learn and plan the way forward. The purpose of the inquiry was to help mitigate and manage the impact of a potential second surge of the virus in care homes. The Committee received 21 submissions from a range of organisations spanning public, private and charitable organisations, professional bodies and trade unions. Shortly before the report was agreed, the HSC began to roll out the vaccination programme. While some of the reports content may, therefore, now be dated, the recommendations are a contribution to present and future planning. The Committee was very aware that this is a rolling situation with continual developments. We welcome the vaccination programme that has been rolled out into our care homes at high speed. That is really welcome and can help to bring them towards some sense of normality.

            One of the strengths of the report is that it looks beyond the current crisis to the reforms that are needed to transform and revitalise the care home sector in the future. The pandemic has laid bare the weaknesses in relationships between the Department, the trusts and care homes. It has also highlighted the great void between staff terms and conditions in the public and private sectors. We want to see cooperation overhauled in those areas. The proof will be in the pudding in terms of the Health Ministers stated plans to bring staff terms into line with those in the public sector.

            The lack of visiting has had a severe and negative impact on families with loved ones in care homes. They have had a particularly difficult and upsetting time not being able to visit their loved ones, and residents have not been able to have that really important time with their family. In line with the Committees recommendation that the care partner scheme be expedited, perhaps the Minister, in his concluding remarks, could include an update on the scheme and its uptake to date and what more he and his Department are doing to encourage it. Several families in great distress have reached out to me on that matter. The inability to see their mum or dad safely and the lack of visitation are causing severe distress and uncertainty. There is also an element of suffering; it is very difficult not to see your loved ones. The lack of visitation has undoubtedly contributed to the cognitive decline of those with dementia. It has been almost a year now -- 11 months -- since families have seen their parents and loved ones due to the fear of passing on the virus.

            I will use the example of one home that I am familiar with. It is a home that has a modern design and an ethos of providing top-class care. That said, it has 40 rooms to be fully serviced, and bedding needs to be changed and cleaned daily. It has corridors, specially adapted bathrooms and common rooms to be cleaned, and four workers share that task during the week. If one worker is off for any reason, the others have to pick up the extra work, which is carried out during a six-hour shift. At weekends, only two staff are on duty to complete those tasks. Shortcuts are inevitable, and, in normal circumstances, they are not visible and do not compromise anyones safety, but, during a pandemic, it can be a different story.

            On that point, I welcome the recommendations. They all make common sense, but we all, as Members, have to reflect that, 18 months ago, we would never have foreseen something as tragic as this hitting us. We were all shocked beyond belief at some of the suggestions that came forward. We took our reliance on care homes as a matter of fact; they were there, and they were there to look after our loved ones. No one predicted what was going to happen.

            The lack of comprehensive pandemic planning for care homes in the private sector left them to their own devices. Recommendation 44 clearly offers a solution. The Committee recommends that future pandemic planning should factor in the central procurement and supply of PPE to care homes. Surely, when we reflect on impact of the pandemic, it will be a matter of immense shame that many care homes were just left to their own devices and left on their own to secure much-needed PPE. In south Down, we had a phenomenal community response when care homes had to put out a call for PPE. That was great and commendable, but it is not how it should have been; that responsibility should have been with the Department of Health.

            In 2020, 775 care home residents died with COVID-19 -- 40% of the deaths in Northern Ireland. Every one of those deaths is an immeasurable loss. For the individuals, their families and care workers, the response was quite simply unacceptable, and we must start to work out what went wrong and make sure that it cannot happen again. How we got into this situation, with such high numbers of deaths in our care homes, is complex. The report outlines many contributing factors, including testing, hospital discharge policies and structural problems in the sector and in Health and Social Care.

            Some 89*9% of applications to the scheme have been processed by my Department. Staff in LPS are working as quickly as possible to resolve the outstanding cases. A high proportion of applications have been incorrect or ineligible, so it has proven to be necessary to check each one. Outstanding applications from the earlier phases of the restrictions are complicated to resolve, with some requiring up to four hours of work by a member of LPS staff to complete. Top-up payments were issued to businesses at the beginning of January. The complexity of the changes arising from the five phases of the health protection restrictions since the start of October has resulted in 27 possible levels of payment, depending on where a business is located and what kind of business it is. That has required some cases to be held back for additional checks, before the top-ups are issued, to ensure that there are no erroneous payments. Every effort is being made to do that as quickly as possible.

The draft Budget recommends an uplift of approximately 1*8% for the Department of Educations resource DEL compared with its present baseline position. That equates to an additional PS41*1 million and would bring its opening budget position to PS2*3 billion. A capital allocation of PS158*3 million has been recommended. That is broadly equivalent to the Departments capital allocation in the last financial year. Unfortunately, the spending review has led to a challenging Budget settlement for all Departments. Consequently, the Education budget could be further increased only by taking money from another Department.

            As the Member will know, Departments, from 2017 right through to January 2020, had no Ministers in place to direct any change in public policy. Since we came into post in 2020, we have been dealing with the very immediate effects of the pandemic. I have to say that the Budget settlement this year was hugely disappointing. Something like PS1*7 billion of pressures were identified by Departments, which cannot be met as part of the Budget settlement. It is a huge challenge.

            As I said, about half of them have been either duplicate applications or an ineligible business type. I accept that the process has taken much longer than we intended. Quite a lot of the data that we expected to get, certainly for close-contact services, did not emerge in a way that was usable. Since the restrictions began again in October, there have been five different levels of restrictions resulting in 27 different levels of payments. That is hugely complex for an organisation to manage. Nonetheless, we wanted it to respond much quicker than it has.

Would your Department be receptive to any bids from, say, the Department for the Economy to celebrate our economic power over the last 100 years; from the Department of Health to celebrate our NHS; or, indeed, from the Department of Agriculture to celebrate our farming during the centenary?

            The Minister will be aware that Westminster announced a programme called Kickstart, and that programme was introduced in September last year. The Minister for Communities wanted to do a bespoke scheme in Northern Ireland and indicated that it would be titled Job Start. According to her, the Department was unable to launch the scheme on 14 December as planned, as there was no funding available for labour market interventions, and, therefore, that scheme is now dormant at the very least.

            Yes, it would have been at that stage that the Department had the good intent to launch additional schemes, particularly recognising the economic impact that the pandemic has had. I have no doubt that it was well intentioned in wanting to launch the scheme. We only learnt on 25 November what our funding envelope was for the Budget, and that was only confirmed on 10 December. The Department then realised that it simply would have the allocation that it had last year, with no scope for additional programmes. That is the draft Budget proposition. It goes through a process of consultation and engagement with all Ministers and other areas that we are looking to in terms of funding possibilities, and then we reach the final Budget proposition stage. If the position does not improve for Departments, they will have to consider whether certain schemes are a priority and, if so, decide what other schemes they might have to drop to meet that priority.

            I do agree with him about making the Budget process more transparent and accessible. We have been working on that and will continue to work on that. He reminded me that, when we were on the Finance Committee together many years back, we pushed that idea, and I am still wedded to the idea of a simpler, more transparent and more accessible Budget process. Of course, the spending review that gave us our funding envelope was to have taken place over last summer. It was pushed back into the autumn. We did not get the final amount until 25 November, and it was not confirmed until 10 December. All the good intentions of this institution are dependent on what processes run through over in Whitehall, and if they stall or delay, it can throw our best intentions awry. Nonetheless, we do need to continue that work to simplify, streamline and make more accessible the Budget process.

            I thank the Member for her supplementary. As she knows, nine work streams and seven subgroups were established in an overarching project to lead the work required to implement the recommendations of the inquiry into the hyponatraemia-related deaths. The work streams and subgroups are a duty of candour; death certification; a duty of quality; paediatric-clinical collaboration; serious adverse incident training; user experience and advocacy; workforce and professional regulation and assurance. I want the recommendations implemented fully but without unintended consequences. To do that, I have gathered over 200 people from different backgrounds to work through how best to implement the recommendations. They include service users and carers; the voluntary and community sector; and people from Health and Social Care organisations. That co-production approach will help to ensure that the changes that we make work in practice.

            The plan for deploying the vaccines is well under way and has been designed to be pragmatic, agile and flexible. The programme started on 8 December, and, by close of play yesterday, 246,421 vaccines had been administered: 221,809 first doses and 24,612 second doses. The deployment plan involves a mixture of delivery models. Most people aged 80 and over should now have been invited to receive their first dose or been advised that they can expect to receive the vaccine. Housebound patients on the GP register who are over 80 will be vaccinated by GPs working in conjunction with their district nursing colleagues. In addition, care home residents not vaccinated by mobile teams will receive the vaccine from a district nurse working with their GP practice. GPs will regularly check their records to ensure that none of their patients in the eligible cohorts has missed out on an offer of vaccination.

            The plan for deploying the vaccines is well under way and has been designed to be pragmatic, agile and flexible. The programme started on 8 December, and, by close of play yesterday, 246,421 vaccines had been administered: 221,809 first doses and 24,612 second doses. The deployment plan involves a mixture of delivery models. Most people aged 80 and over should now have been invited to receive their first dose or been advised that they can expect to receive the vaccine. Housebound patients on the GP register who are over 80 will be vaccinated by GPs working in conjunction with their district nursing colleagues. In addition, care home residents not vaccinated by mobile teams will receive the vaccine from a district nurse working with their GP practice. GPs will regularly check their records to ensure that none of their patients in the eligible cohorts has missed out on an offer of vaccination.

            The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has identified the best option for preventing mortality and morbidity as being, initially, to protect those most at risk, namely persons falling within groups 1 to 9. The vaccination plan has therefore been targeted at the specific age cohorts of the population most at risk and does not measure deployment against overall population numbers. However, vaccination deployment is an ongoing programme, and it is subject primarily to the availability of the vaccine, which means that the average weekly rate is likely to change and increase as larger cohorts of the population come forward to be vaccinated.

We are working with somewhere in the region of 321 GP practices, which are rolling out the vaccination programme to the elderly cohorts and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. They are calling forward patients to fill specific time slots, so it is not done on a first come, first served basis. Most of the slots are being taken up by people who are called forward, rather than there being any surplus at the end of the day.

            I thank the Member for that point. There has been much discussion of the issue since the EU triggered article 16 on Friday. That had potentially very real implications for us because we had vaccine in transit. Had article 16 been enforced, we may have seen difficulties with the arrival of a supply of vaccine in Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to those officials in my Department who were working vigorously behind the scenes while the noise was being made on Friday evening to make sure that that dispatch of vaccines arrived here on Friday night and was fit to be distributed through our practices and vaccination centres. Vaccines should not become political. We have been very clear over the last year that fighting COVID-19 is not about politics but about saving lives.

            In January 2021, the Department further extended its COVID-19 testing policy to make provision for testing to be accessible to designated care partners. Consequently, if a care home advises that there is a requirement for a care partner to be tested for COVID-19, that will be undertaken through the regular care home testing programme. We are progressing work on a number of new testing interventions (NTI), including a care home NTI, which has recently commenced using lateral flow devices to support the visiting policy in care home settings. I am also pleased to say that all Northern Irelands 483 care homes have been visited by our vaccination teams, and, by the close of play on Saturday evening, 410 had received their second visit.

            Discharge policy is an area that we continue to keep under active consideration. We want to protect care homes from any risk of infection and ensure that residents are not held in hospital, with the risk that that creates for them, any longer than they need to be. The Assembly will be aware that it remains the case that individuals who are discharged from a hospital to a care home should be tested for COVID-19, ideally 48 hours before discharge, and be subject to 14 days isolation on arrival. I hope that the research undertaken by Dr [GDPRREDACT] and published by my Department has helped to ensure that there is informed debate in that area.

            We are all too aware of the statistics behind the pandemic. They have become daily reading for people across the country who are looking for a glimmer of hope and willing to see an improvement. However, for far too many families, it is not just a statistic; instead, it is about a mother, a father, a grandmother, a grandfather, a loved one. As the Chair stated, it is over 775 of our care home residents. I thank the many individuals and families who engaged with the Committee during the inquiry process. It is important that the voices of residents and their families are heard and that they stay central to how the Minister responds over the coming weeks and months.

            The Minister talked about testing and said that the Department is fully committed to taking measures to support staff and residents in continuing the testing process. He also touched on the care partner issue and said that testing will be taken in the care home setting if that is requested. It is important to remember, as the Minister mentioned, that all 483 care homes have seen the vaccinators and that 410 have had their second vaccination visit; that is very welcome news. Testing on discharge from hospital settings to home, which is to be done 48 hours in advance, is well documented. He touched on the fact that millions of items of PPE continue to be provided free of charge to these healthcare settings; that is also important.

            The Minister talked about testing and said that the Department is fully committed to taking measures to support staff and residents in continuing the testing process. He also touched on the care partner issue and said that testing will be taken in the care home setting if that is requested. It is important to remember, as the Minister mentioned, that all 483 care homes have seen the vaccinators and that 410 have had their second vaccination visit; that is very welcome news. Testing on discharge from hospital settings to home, which is to be done 48 hours in advance, is well documented. He touched on the fact that millions of items of PPE continue to be provided free of charge to these healthcare settings; that is also important.

            We, as a party, welcome the publication of the report. It and its 54 detailed recommendations come after extensive and very meaningful engagement. We thank all stakeholders who provided evidence to the inquiry in what remain very challenging times. The roll-out of the vaccine will dramatically change the nature of the public health response, but that does not mean that we should not reflect seriously on the deficiencies of steps taken in the first wave and use that learning to adopt more effective measures in any future crisis scenario.

            The former Chairperson wrote to the Speaker on 6 November 2020 outlining that decision and requesting an informal meeting with Assembly officials to discuss the practical and procedural implications of remote access to the Chamber for plenary sittings.

            I really hope that people out there understand that, when we are self-isolating or working from home, we are working. As many in this Building can confirm, our job is not a nine-to-five one; it is probably closer to 14 to 15 hours a day. People will be able to see that we are at home and concentrating. The new Standing Orders that will be tabled by the Committee are very welcome. I appreciate that it will be no easy job to try to deal with interventions and points of order, so I welcome the Committees thoughts on that. We can, of course, review the process as time goes on and we see how it works.

            The issues with the protocol can be resolved. No one is starving, as [GDPRREDACT] claims, and the economy has not been strangled as a result of the protocol. Those are myths and mistruths. They are provocative terms, so let us calm ourselves and work with one another, the Dublin and British Governments and the EU to ensure that whatever outstanding issues there are with the protocol can be resolved. However, I appeal to you: calm your language, stop sabre-rattling and we will get through this.

            We intend to, and have agreed that we will, continue, but it is just very unfortunate that none of us can go to London to meet collectively in the Treasury. We have to make joint virtual representations at the moment to the Treasury, but we will continue to do that. I think that it is a most unsatisfactory approach by the Treasury and the Government in London generally, and it is certainly not what we were promised. There was to have been a pilot programme for next year and, as yet, we do not have any detail on that at all. There is a real concern that, in the transition of that, we are going to lose substantial amounts of money.

            I am certainly supportive of the two-island approach to hotel quarantine, specifically working on a five-nations basis to progress that. There will be a quad meeting this afternoon between us, the Secretary of State and Ministers from the Republic of Ireland, at which, I am sure, that issue will be raised. The Member will be aware that there were concerns about the sharing of data and information on passenger locator forms. That work is still ongoing. We hope that there will be a resolution as to how that data can be shared. The Member knows that, if we do not get that information from people landing at Dublin Airport, there is a weakness in the steps that we take in Northern Ireland, so we need a two-island approach, as he rightly acknowledged in his question.
